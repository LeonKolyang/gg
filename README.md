## Welcome

Welcome to all Gatsby Graphics members!  We are adding members all the time and perhaps we should examine what our relationship is to Gatsby and to our world.

The Great Gatsby was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald during the 1920s, a time of very rapid societal change and evolution.  The book expressed views that our lives were becoming complicated and convoluted in many ways and it tried to make some sense of those changes and perhaps simplify things a bit.

There are many, many opinions written about Gatsby and the relationship to the life of the times, but some things are clear.  Jay Gatsby, the central character, and most of the other characters were trying to find a way of dealing with the changes taking place.  Gatsby loved beautiful women, “fast” women, and beautiful, fast cars.

Today we are dealing with societal changes too and we are looking for ways to simplify and speed up the processes of dealing with life in general.  So the Gatsby Graphics teams on GitHub are dealing with our environment by simplifying, beautifying and speeding up our ability to enjoy life as it is and as it will be.

## Learning Lab

The GG team will aim to on board people to GitHub in an easy fashion.

Our focus will be on learning, graphics and Gatsby in general including GatsbyJS.
